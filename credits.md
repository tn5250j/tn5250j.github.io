Special thanks go out to the pre-beta testers that test the constant changes before anyone else gets to see it. When they say there are no problems then I release the code to the others:

* Irene Serrano
* Jesus Irausquin
* Didac Lopez
* Ricardo Fermin
* Patrick Bielen
* Christian Geisert
* Nicola Ken Barozzi - Donated code for the SQL Query Wizard and Spooled File

_Without their constant testing and feedback there would be a lot more bugs._
