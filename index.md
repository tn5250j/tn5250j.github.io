## Introduction

The tn5250j is a 5250 terminal emulator for the AS/400 written in Java. It was created because there was no terminal emulator for Linux with features like continued edit fields, gui windows, cursor progression fields etc....

From there it has seemed to go off in all sorts of directions. Now there are 3 modes:

- A basic mode that most emulators I have found are.
- Enhanced mode that implements the features that I wanted like masked edit fields and those listed above.
- The third is a gui mode that turns the bland green-screen into a windows gui (See screen shots).

## History

The project was open sourced to give something back to all those hackers and code churners that work so hard to provide the Linux and Open Source communities with quality work and software.

The original developer wanted it to work on different operating systems, thus Java giving the "J" at the end.
